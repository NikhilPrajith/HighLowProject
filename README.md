## Higher Or Lower Project

Collaborators: Nikhil Prajith Kumar and Mohammad Musfiqur Rahman

### Overview:

This application allows users to select from a list of 4 categories: YouTube Subscribers, Net-worth, Heights, and Grocery. After the selection is made, two pieces of data are displayed along with an image representing them. However, one of the values of the data is hidden, and the user has to make a choice as to whether the secret value is higher or lower than the value present in the other data. Once a correct prediction is made, the game continues with more data that will be compared with the information the user correctly guessed
